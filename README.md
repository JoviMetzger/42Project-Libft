# ðŸ“š Libft

This repository contains my own C library, called "libft".

## About

The library was created as part of my 42_cursus program to rewrite standard C functions from scratch. The library(libft) contains a collection of functions with the same prototypes and expected behavior as the original functions in the standard C library (libc), but with the prefix 'ft_'  (ft_functionName).
It is a great way for a beginner to learn and understand C.

## Installation

To install this library, follow the steps below:

1. Compile the library by running the following command:
```bash
make
```
2. You can create your own main() or use my main() which I have included/commented out in each function.

3. Finally, execute the program using the following command: 
```bash
./libft
```
